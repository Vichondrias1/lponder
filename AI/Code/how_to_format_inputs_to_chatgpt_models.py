# How to format inputs to ChatGPT models

ChatGPT is powered by `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`, OpenAI's most advanced models.

You can build your own applications with `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` using the OpenAI API.

Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return an AI-written message as output.

This guide illustrates the chat format with a few example API calls.

## 1. Import the openai library
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# if needed, install and/or upgrade to the latest version of the OpenAI Python library
# %pip install --upgrade openai
# %pip install tiktoken

# import the OpenAI Python library for calling the OpenAI API
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import json

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "sk-ptw-bSv7ViSdzZhD9nemGyj2T3BlbkFJOPvsQvhpy7v7yWVme3DR"))

"""## 2. An example chat completion API call

A chat completion API call parameters,
**Required**
- `model`: the name of the model you want to use (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-1106`)
- `messages`: a list of message objects, where each object has two required fields:
    - `role`: the role of the messenger (either `system`, `user`, `assistant` or `tool`)
    - `content`: the content of the message (e.g., `Write me a beautiful poem`)

Messages can also contain an optional `name` field, which give the messenger a name. E.g., `example-user`, `Alice`, `BlackbeardBot`. Names may not contain spaces.

**Optional**
- `frequency_penalty`: Penalizes tokens based on their frequency, reducing repetition.
- `logit_bias`: Modifies likelihood of specified tokens with bias values.
- `logprobs`: Returns log probabilities of output tokens if true.
- `top_logprobs`: Specifies the number of most likely tokens to return at each position.
- `max_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of generated tokens in chat completion.
- `n`: Generates a specified number of chat completion choices for each input.
- `presence_penalty`: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in the text.
- `response_format`: Specifies the output format, e.g., JSON mode.
- `seed`: Ensures deterministic sampling with a specified seed.
- `stop`: Specifies up to 4 sequences where the API should stop generating tokens.
- `stream`: Sends partial message deltas as tokens become available.
- `temperature`: Sets the sampling temperature between 0 and 2.
- `top_p`: Uses nucleus sampling; considers tokens with top_p probability mass.
- `tools`: Lists functions the model may call.
- `tool_choice`: Controls the model's function calls (none/auto/function).
- `user`: Unique identifier for end-user monitoring and abuse detection.


As of January 2024, you can also optionally submit a list of `functions` that tell GPT whether it can generate JSON to feed into a function. For details, see the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling), [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat), or the Cookbook guide [How to call functions with chat models](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb).

Typically, a conversation will start with a system message that tells the assistant how to behave, followed by alternating user and assistant messages, but you are not required to follow this format.

Let's look at an example chat API calls to see how the chat format works in practice.

"""As you can see, the response object has a few fields:
- `id`: the ID of the request
- `choices`: a list of completion objects (only one, unless you set `n` greater than 1)
    - `finish_reason`: the reason the model stopped generating text (either `stop`, or `length` if `max_tokens` limit was reached)
    - `index`: The index of the choice in the list of choices.
    - `logprobs`: Log probability information for the choice.
    - `message`: the message object generated by the model
        - `content`: content of message
        - `role`: The role of the author of this message.
        - `tool_calls`: The tool calls generated by the model, such as function calls. if the tools is given
- `created`: the timestamp of the request
- `model`: the full name of the model used to generate the response
- `object`: the type of object returned (e.g., `chat.completion`)
- `system_fingerprint`: This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with.
- `usage`: the number of tokens used to generate the replies, counting prompt, completion, and total

Extract just the reply with:

response.choices[0].message.content

"""Even non-conversation-based tasks can fit into the chat format, by placing the instruction in the first user message.

"""## 3. Tips for instructing gpt-3.5-turbo-0301

Best practices for instructing models may change from model version to model version. The advice that follows applies to `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` and may not apply to future models.

### System messages

The system message can be used to prime the assistant with different personalities or behaviors.

Be aware that `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` does not generally pay as much attention to the system message as `gpt-4-0314` or `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`. Therefore, for `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`, we recommend placing important instructions in the user message instead. Some developers have found success in continually moving the system message near the end of the conversation to keep the model's attention from drifting away as conversations get longer.
"""

# An example of a system message that primes the assistant to explain concepts in great depth
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly and helpful teaching assistant. You explain concepts in great depth using simple terms, and you give examples to help people learn. At the end of each explanation, you ask a question to check for understanding"},

"""### Few-shot prompting

In some cases, it's easier to show the model what you want rather than tell the model what you want.

One way to show the model what you want is with faked example messages.

For example:

"""Not every attempt at engineering conversations will succeed at first.

If your first attempts fail, don't be afraid to experiment with different ways of priming or conditioning the model.

As an example, one developer discovered an increase in accuracy when they inserted a user message that said "Great job so far, these have been perfect" to help condition the model into providing higher quality responses.

For more ideas on how to lift the reliability of the models, consider reading our guide on [techniques to increase reliability](../techniques_to_improve_reliability). It was written for non-chat models, but many of its principles still apply.

## 4. Counting tokens

When you submit your request, the API transforms the messages into a sequence of tokens.

The number of tokens used affects:
- the cost of the request
- the time it takes to generate the response
- when the reply gets cut off from hitting the maximum token limit (4,096 for `gpt-3.5-turbo` or 8,192 for `gpt-4`)

You can use the following function to count the number of tokens that a list of messages will use.

Note that the exact way that tokens are counted from messages may change from model to model. Consider the counts from the function below an estimate, not a timeless guarantee.

In particular, requests that use the optional functions input will consume extra tokens on top of the estimates calculated below.

Read more about counting tokens in [How to count tokens with tiktoken](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb).
